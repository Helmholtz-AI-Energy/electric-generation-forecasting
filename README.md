# Electric Generation Forecasting (EGF)
## AI-based Prediction of the German Electricity Mix

This repository deals with AI-based prediction of the German electricity mix.

### Problem
We want to perform time series prediction of the ENTSO-E actual generation per production type and actual load data, 
i.e., predict the values of these quantities as a "vector" for the next time step(s) from historic data. This basically 
is multi output regression. We are interested in the short-term load forecasting regime (from 24 h to one week). STLF is 
essential for controlling and scheduling of the power system in making everyday power system operation, interchange 
evaluation, security assessment, reliability analysis, and spot price calculation, which leads to the higher accuracy 
requirement compared to long-term prediction.

### Data
We consider the actual generation per production type and the actual load in Germany from the [ENTSO-E 
transparency platform](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/). The data is published daily and has a 15-min frequency. 
**After applying for your personal security token**, you can download the data via the RESTful API from the ENTSO-E 
transparency platform. We use the [entsoe-py Python package](https://github.com/EnergieID/entsoe-py) as a Python client for this.

From the [official documentation](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2013:163:0001:0012:EN:PDF):

>#### Actual Generation per Production Type
>Actual aggregated net generation output (MW) per market time unit and per production type.
The information shall be published no later than one hour after the operational period.

>**Specification of calculation** Average of all available instantaneous net generation output values on each market time unit. If a net generation output is not known, it shall be estimated. The actual generation of small-scale units might be estimated if no real-time measurement devices exist.

>**Primary owner of the data** Owners of generation units or transmission system operators (TSOs)  
>**Data provider** TSOs or other Data Provider of information depending on local organisation.

#### Manual inspection of exemplary data for GER downloaded as CSV file 

In an exemplary data snippet downloaded for Germany, there are 23 columns, i.e., raw features:
>- A. Area: All the same because we are only interested in Germany (DE).

To reduce the problem complexity, we apply the category mapping from Unnewehr et al. (2022),

### Models

#### Statistical methods

* **Persistence**
    * Used as a baseline model / reference for evaluating a model's predictive power / performance. 
    * Useful to know if a forecast model provides better results than a trivial reference model, here the persistence model.
    * Persistence represents probably the simplest way of producing a forecast. A persistence model assumes that the future 
      value of a time series is calculated under the assumption that nothing changes between the current time and the forecast time. 
      In terms of the electricity mix, the persistence model estimates that the mix at time t+1 equals the mix at time t.


* **Standard load profiles (SLPs)**
    * https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9221967
    * 3 different categories: weekday, Saturday, Sun-/Holiday
    * Use category-based average of last n profiles as forecast: Last(n) category-forecast
    * Usually: n = 3 (can also capture seasonal + weather related changes)
    * Last(1) = persistence (tomorrow will be the same as today), 
      simple + efficient, but struggles with weekends + holidays.
    * Useful Python package: `holidays`

#### Notes
- Include weather data from Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD), dwd.de, Python interface exists, data probably available as a grid, use averages over all Germany as input features?
- Calculate merit order number for training data and predict that?
- Check flow tracing / production- vs. consumption-based data ENTSO-E.
- Modifying input artificially is a bad idea, Out-Of-Sample Distribution, if one were to do this, NN needs to be trained on synthetic data as well!
